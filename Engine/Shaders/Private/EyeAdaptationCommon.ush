// This eye adaptation lookup function is used by the material template. However, post process materials also require
// it, but are themselves global shaders which can utilize loose parameters instead. Rules for the implementation:
//  - Defining EYE_ADAPTATION_DISABLED will cause it to always return 0.
//  - Defining EyeAdaptationStruct will cause it to pull from that uniform buffer struct.
//  - Defining EYE_ADAPTATION_LOOSE_PARAMETERS will cause it to pull from the loose texture / buffer.
//  - Doing none of the above will fall back to disabled.
